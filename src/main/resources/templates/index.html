                            Within his bending sickle's compass come;

                            If this be error and upon me proved,

                            It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
                            Whose worth's unknown, although his heighth be taken.
                            Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
                            Within his bending sickle's compass come;
                            Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
                            But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
                            If this be error and upon me proved,
                            I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</h1>
